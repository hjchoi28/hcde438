          I am a senior studying HCDE at the University of Washington, Seattle.
          As an aspiring UX Writer, I aim to simplify user experiences through meaningful design and text
          that are informed by <em>empathy</em>, <em>creativity</em>, and <em>data</em>.
          When I am not honing my UX skills and exploring the applications of Design Thinking at school,
          I spend my time playing violin and ukulele.
