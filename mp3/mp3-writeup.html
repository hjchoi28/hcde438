        <h1>MP3 Writeup</h1>
        <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
          <p>For MP3, I created a 2D game using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://p5play.org/">p5.play</a> libraries,
            where the goal is to help the space ktty avoid colliding with asteroids in space.
            The player can control the movement of the space kitty with their mouse and the game continues infinitely until the player hits the asteroids.
            However, the speed of the asteroids also increases as the game progresses, making it more difficult.
            Once the end condition is met, the timer and game resets, and the player is encouraged to try again.
            <ul>
              <li>Play the game at <a href="https://hjchoi28.github.io/space-kitty/">hjchoi28.github.io/space-kitty/</a></li>
              <li>Check out the code in my <a href="https://github.com/hjchoi28/space-kitty">Public Github Repository</a>
            </ul>
            The purpose of MP3 was to learn how to use NPM to install libraries, a local development server, and bundle code.
            I also learned how to deploy my project on Github Pages.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <p>
            I started this project by setting up my development toolchain using Hannah's example <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/06_toolchain.md">Dev Toolchain Walkthrough</a>.
            I used the sample <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/quinton-ashley/sketches/szN_XdV5O">p5.play starter code</a> to try deploying my game.
            Once I confirmed everything worked, I started writing my actual game code.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I looked at Allison Parrish's <a href="https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/">p5.play tutorial</a>
            to understand the basics of the p5.play library. Then, I divided the core function of my game into manageable steps I could implement.
            I explored creating sprites by creating a static group of grey square sprites to represent the asteroids,
            and adding the image of the space kitty to a sprite that follows the mouse position.
          </p>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="setup-kitty.png"
            alt="White background with the text: 'avoid the asteroids' in the center, three grey squares to the left, and a kitty icon wearing a space helmet to the right"
            />
          <p>
            After figuring out how the sprites worked, I then worked on making the asteroids dynamic.
            I struggled with creating a reasonable number of the sprites since the <code>draw()</code> function would continuously create them until it covered the whole screen.
            I eventually figured it out using the p5.play demos. Read more details in the "Issue Deep-Dive" section below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I added the end condition. When the kitty sprite overlaps with any of the asteroids in the sprite group,
            the game ends and resets. With this, I finished the core functions of the game and had time to add more features.
            One of the additions was a timer, which I implemented using the <code>setInterval()</code> function.
            I also made the speed of the asteroids gradually increase to make the gameplay more interesting and challenging.
            For visual effects, I made the asteroids rotate and loaded an image of an asteroid icon to the sprites.
            Lastly, I made sure players can replay the game without having the refresh the entire page.
          </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="trailing-error.png"
            alt="trail of kitty icons with space helmets"
            />
          <p>
            The first issue I encountered was with the kitty avatar leaving a trail whenever the mouse moved.
            The code worked when I was using the p5,js editor but not when I wrote the same code on VSCode.
            I realized the reason was because I was adding to the starter code, which had the <code>background()</code> in the <code>draw()</code> function already.
            Meanwhile, I was accustomed to setting the background color in the <code>setup()</code> function.
            By having the background color set everytime the <code>draw()</code> function is looped,
            it covers the kitty image from the previous position and only shows the image where the mouse is currently positioned.
          </p>
          <img
              class="picture"
              src="asteroid-error.png"
              alt="dark blue background with multiple grey circles surrounding a kitty icon"
            />
          <p>
            The second issue was with creating the asteroid sprites. Because I created the sprites in the <code>draw()</code> function,
            the asteroids were continually made until it covered and blocked the whole window. I changed it to create the sprites in the <code>setup()</code> functions.
            This made it so I could control the exact number of asteroids that would appear in the game. However, this meant I couldn't remove the asteroids once they left the window
            or else the asteroids will eventually all be removed, making it impossible to trigger the end condition of the game.
            So instead, I learned how to change the position of the asteroids so that once they moved past a certain number of pixels from the window edges,
            they would reappear on the other end of the window. Creating the asteroids in the <code>setup()</code> function also made it easier to reset the game without refreshing the window.
          </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Adjust the size of the kitty and asteroid depending on the window size</li>
            <li>Make it playable on mobile devices</li>
            <li>Include start and end screens; give player option to continue playing</li>
            <li>Add a shooting mechanic to destroy the asteroids</li>
          </ul>
