        <h1>FP0 Proposal</h1>
          <p>For my final project, I will update the game I made for <a href="https://hjchoi28.github.io/mp3/mp3-writeup">MP3</a> with a scoreboard using firebase.</p>
        <h2>Prototype Version</h2>
          <p>
            The prototype will focus on making sure firebase is properly storing the user data.
            Some parts like the number of seconds (score) will be hardcoded, but the aim is to accept user input
            for the username. This prototype will also have minimal styling, with only necessary code, like buttons.
            The scores will be shown in order of when the username was inputted.
          </p>
          <img
              class="picture"
              src="prototype-ver.png"
              alt="prototype interface"
            />
        <h2>Final Version</h2>
          <p>
            For the final version, I will make the leaderboard show players in order of highest to lowest scores.
            The scores of the current player will also be shown, along with their rank.
            Then, I will also add more CSS styling to make it more visually appealing.
          </p>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="final-ver.png"
            alt="final version interface"
            />
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a public repository for the prototype (consider using Hannah's template).</li>
            <li>Follow <a href="https://github.com/branchwelder/web-technologies/blob/main/activities/09_firebase.md">Hannah's tutorial</a> on setting up firebase.</li>
            <li>Create a simple html file to render the view of the projec.t</li>
            <li>Collect and send user input to database, then render the usernames and monitor for changes.</li>
            <li>Hardcode sample scores to test and complete the scoreboard prototype.</li>
            <li>Add the mp3 game to the firebase project.</li>
            <li>Make it so once the game ends, the user input prompt and scoreboard renders.</li>
            <li><b>Milestone 1:</b> Complete and present the prototype in class (3/9)</li>
            <li>Create a public repository for the final version by cloning the prototype</li>
            <li>Confirm everything is properly installed</li>
            <li>Instead of hardcoding fake scores, send the scores from the game file to database</li>
            <li>Make the scoreboard code more robust by storing or rendering them in order of score (highest to lowest)</li>
            <li>Add CSS styling to the user input prompt page</li>
            <li>Add CSS styling to the scoreboard page</li>
            <li><b>Milestone 2:</b> Complete and submit the final version</li>
          </ol>
