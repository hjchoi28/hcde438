        <h1>FP2 Writeup</h1>
        <h2>Overview & Usage</h2>
          <p>For my final project prototype, I used firebase to add a scoreboard to the <a href="https://hjchoi28.github.io/mp3/mp3-writeup">MP3 game</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>Play my final game at <a href="https://hjchoi28.github.io/fp1-prototype/">hjchoi28.github.io/fp2-final/</a></li>
              <li>Check out the code in my <a href="https://github.com/hjchoi28/fp2-final">Public Github Repository</a>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <p>
            I continued working from where I stopped at the prototype by making the <a href="https://github.com/hjchoi28/fp1-prototype">prototype repository</a> into a template and using it for the final.
            Then, I made sure that I could start, build, and deploy the project properly.
            Once I fixed confirmed everything worked, I mostly just worked on the project locally with <code>npm run start</code> until I completed the prototype.
          </p>

            class="picture"
            src="leaderboard.png"
            alt="White background with the header 'Leaderboard', a button labelled 'Play Again', and game scores"
            />
          <p>
            After I figured out the input view and the score view, I also implemented buttons. By this point, I had yet to add the game itself.
            So, I had the "Play Again" button call on the function that renders the input view instead. This helped make sure that I was using the event listener
            and further test the database with my nickname input and hardcoded scores. I also imported the <code>orderBy</code> function to order the scores from highest to lowest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I added the game. It took a while to figure it out but I managed to fix the logical and syntax errors (more details below in Issue Deep-Dive).
            I also figured out how to add the scores to the database, which was a step I planned to do in the final version, so I no longer need to hardcode the score for the demo in class.
          </p>
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <img
            class="picture"
            src="error-404.png"
            alt="Error 404 website not found message for github pages"
          />
          <p>
            The first issue I encountered was a simple syntax error. When I tried to build and deploy the prototype,
            there was an error message that my index.js file could not be bundled. This was easy to fix since all I needed to do was add <code>type="module"</code>
            to the script src line in the index.html file. I also had an issue where the file could not be found, which I fixed by changing the base path in the package.json file:
            <code>"deploy": "vite build --base=/fp1-prototype/ && gh-pages -d dist"</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            The other issues were more logical. When I tried to add the actual game and have the user input prompt page show only after the user loses,
            the game wouldn't render. I looked back at my code and the p5js functions like <code>draw</code> were greyed out.
            Shi Ming helped by showing that I could use code like <code>window.draw</code> instead, which will make it appear.
            I still had issues where if I pressed "Play Again", instead of resetting the game, it would take me back to the user input prompt.
            I fixed the issue by making sure I was calling the correct functions and adding a global variable to keep track of when the player is alive or not.
          </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Explore firebase more to make space kitty into a multiplayer game</li>
            <li>Make it into a popup game with chrome browser extension</li>
            <li>Add extra game mechanics like ability to shoot/destroy asteroids or shield against them</li>
          </ul>
