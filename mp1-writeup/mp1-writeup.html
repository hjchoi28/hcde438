        <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <p>
            First, I looked at the extension examples provided and familiarized myself with some of the common elements and commands.
            Then, I sketched an idea of what the html and css would look like. I also thought about what javascript methods I could use to achieve my goals.

          <img
            class="picture"
            src="unfinished-site.png"
            />
        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
          <p>
            The issues I encountered were with the cursor image, flex box content, and event listener.
            For the cursor, the image would not load properly. First, I wanted to know if the image was the problem
            or if the line of code had an issue. To do so, I set the fallback cursor keyword to "help".
            So when the cursor changed to the "help", I knew that it was because the specified image failed to load.
            Then, I made sure to properly declare the path to the image (cursors/cursor-name.png).
            After further reseach, I realized the issue was with the size of the image. It is recommended to use icons that are at most 32x32 px.
            Once I changed the size, the image was able to load properly.

        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Add more options for the cursor cat</li>
            <li>Add more options for the playroom background</li>
            <li>Consider making the playroom a separate new tab</li>
          </ul>
